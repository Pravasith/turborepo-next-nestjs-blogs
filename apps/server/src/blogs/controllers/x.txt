Hi Pravasith,

I hope your day is going well. As discussed, we would like to move forward with your application. 
I've just sent out the coding challenge (here is the link just in case, [http://theviv.co/codingchallenge](http://theviv.co/codingchallenge)). 
Because you are on the more experienced side of the spectrum, we'd like to define a couple more criteria for this challenge. 
Primarily on the frontend side of things.

Extended Criteria:
- Ensure strong user experience
   - Good accessibility practices
   - Clean user feedback on error and loading states
- Ensure the UI ascetically pleasing
   - Use of component libraries and customization of their components
   - Responsive design with little code duplication
      - Ensure content does not stretch past 1440px
      - Ensure content is presentable down to 320px
      - Add animations and transitions as you see fit

Best Regards,
Kevin Feddema
