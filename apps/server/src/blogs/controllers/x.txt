I need to connect to a remote postgres database with the following credentials:

DB_HOST='challenge.postgres.database.azure.com'
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME='userchallenge@code-challenge'
DB_PASSWORD='challenge'
DB_NAME='challenge'

The database contains a table called 'blogs'. I need a single get route that gets all the data in the table.
The table structure is as follows:

| Column           |  Type  |                   Explanation |
| ---------------- | :----: | ----------------------------: |
| id               | number |            Unique database id |
| title            | string |                    Blog Title |    
| slug             | string |            Unique string slug |       
| content          | string |        The blogs html content |
| image            | string |          The blogs main image |
| published_at     |  date  |   When the blog was published | (nullable)

I need to do this in nestJS using TypeORM, can you help me with the steps?
